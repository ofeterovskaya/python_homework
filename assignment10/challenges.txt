# One challenge was finding the correct element for the Top 10 list in the DOM.
# At first the scraper returned an empty list, so I had to adjust the selector and wait for content to load.

# The second challenge was that the OWASP Top 10 page loads its content with JavaScript,
# so the expected items were not present immediately in the HTML. 
# I resolved this by waiting for the page to render and then filtering links by their A01–A10 pattern.

# Another challenge was that the initial selector targeted the wrong section, 
# which returned translation links instead of the Top 10 list. 
# I fixed this by inspecting the page and adjusting the selector to match the Top 10 item links.
